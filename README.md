## My Motivation

I want to learn Python, R, and Git because I am interested in data analysis for human movement.  
These tools will help me manage and analyze data efficiently.  
I enjoy solving problems and automating tasks using programming.  
Learning Git will allow me to collaborate with others on projects easily.  
I am excited to improve my skills and apply them in future research and projects.
